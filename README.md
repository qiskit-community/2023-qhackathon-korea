## How do I start if I have an idea for the hackathon?   ![Github Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%20Template-121013?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)

- Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/2023-qhackathon-korea/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template.

- Don't worry if your team is not complete yet.
Tag your project with `members wanted` and describe what kind of member are your searching for in the `Members` section.
- The project should have no more than 5 members.



## What if my team is complete? ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Issue%20Label-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white&color=8B8000)

- Approach or ask a Qiskit coach to remove the label `members wanted` from your issue.

## My project plan is ready. I want to start!  ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ready%20To%20Start-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white&color=g)

- After your project is defined and the team is complete, you can ask an IBMer to add the label `group ready`. This should happen before the group formation stage is finished, around noon of the first day. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## My team needs a coach/mentor!

- There will be Qiskit coaches online and offline to guide and advice your team project.
- They will also be your contact point after the hackathon, in case the project will have be continued on.
- The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.
